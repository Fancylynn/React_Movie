# React_Movie
Edu.chat first task

The aim of doing this task is to evaluate the ability of JavaScript and React. 

Version 1.0:
  The first version is done locally without using any framework. No CSS was added to the project but the code can realize the basic function of having input form that contains the information of title, year of release, director, poster link. The input information will be stored locally and can be retrieved in the table format. 
  
Version 2.0: 
  The second version is a react based project in which users can add movies to localstorage and retrieve the data in table format. CSS was added to change how things look. (It was later on revised by decomposing into different components; Inproper terms were changed to the more descriptive ones)
  
Version 3.0:
  The third version is a react-redux based project which users can add movies to localstorage and retrieve the data in table format. It is revised based on version 2.0.
